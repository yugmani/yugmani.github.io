                    I am a web developer. I have good knowledge of front-end techniques. 
                    I started my career as a middle school teacher after my graduation in mathematics. 
                    When I moved into this new world (USA), 
                    I was not able to continue my career as a teacher due to different kinds of requirements and credentials. 
                    This moment was really hard to choose a new career among the limited options that I had. 
                    <br><br>
                    I used to love working in computer and surfing internet. 
                    Hard working and deep learning mostly through the self-learning and innovation have always been my way of gaining knowledge and skills. 
                    Consequently, I got confidence to delve into the arena of web development. 
                    Intensive coding bootcamp training at UCLA Extension have been a dream institution for the most talent and innovative developers to become a highly skillful leader in the field. 
                    Fortunately, I  got opportunity to rock into this platform.
